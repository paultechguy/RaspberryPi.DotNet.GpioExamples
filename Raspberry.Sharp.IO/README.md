These files are part of the Raspberry# IO github files found at https://github.com/raspberry-sharp/raspberry-sharp-io. These files provide the low-level access to the GPIO pins and supported devices.

Although there is a nuget package for this repository at the time of the PaulTechGuy.RPi.DotNetKickstart release, the nuget package did not contain all the necessary files to support Components and Integrated Circuits.  Therefore, we provide them here for convenience.

There is no official release version for the Raspberry# IO repository; the files included here were built from the repository as of February 1, 2017.
